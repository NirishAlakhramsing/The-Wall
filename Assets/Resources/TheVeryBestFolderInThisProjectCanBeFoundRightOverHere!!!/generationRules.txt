random generation rules:
- leave at least xx% with empty cells
- leave the wall area empty
- make sure theres always an empty area for resources on the south side (bottom for 2D field) of the wall
- make sure theres always an empty path area from the north side of the field to the wall (top for 2D field)
- should give a warning popup about or somehow keep the previously changed cells?

scramble rules:
- allocate all the patches of the same type of cells
- relocate these properly, however they cannot break any of the rules from the random generation
- this tool does not generate new cells, just relocates them
- multiple patches cannot be placed on top of eachother, but they can be connected next to each other
- single cells will be collected and randomly placed after the main patches have been relocated to different places

grow rules:
- always grow towards the nearest empty or differently colored cell.
- if the cell is the same color it will grow towards a different direction or from one of the connected cell if all connecting cells are the same.
- the growth cell including all the other same colored cells will be added to the already visited cells
- if a cell is surrounded by visited cells, it will change color to the most commonly type of cell connected to that cell instead
- empty cells cannot grow
- certain empty cells cannot be grown towards (wall, wall path and collect items area)
- certain filled cells cannot be grown towards even if no other cell will be a viable grow direction (other bigger patches, exception to patches that are smaller)
